- **Device CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete IoT devices
- **Device Types**: Support for various device types (Sensors, Cameras, Smart Lights, Temperature Sensors, etc.)
- **Device Sharing**: Share devices with other group members with granular permissions
- **Device Access Control**: Control who can view, monitor, or control each device
- **Admin Override**: Super admins can access and manage all devices across all groups

#### **User & Group Management**
- **Role-based Access Control**: Group admins and members with different permission levels
- **User Registration Workflow**: New users request access and admins approve/assign to groups
- **Group Administration**: Create, update, and delete groups with member management
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user administration with search and filtering
- **Permission Management**: Granular control over user permissions and group access

#### **Modern User Interface**

## How It Works

1. **URL Routing**: When you visit the root URL (`/`), Django:
   - Checks `myproject/urls.py` 
   - Finds the include for `myapp.urls`
   - Routes to `myapp/urls.py`
   - Matches the empty path `''` to the `index` view

2. **View Processing**: The `index` view in `myapp/views.py`:
   - Receives the HTTP request
   - Returns an HttpResponse with the "Hello, World!" message

3. **App Registration**: The `myapp` is registered in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`

## Available Pages

Once the server is running, you can access:

### **Public Pages**
- **Home**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - Main dashboard with group overview

### IoT Data Protocol

The system uses JSON over TCP with timezone-aware timestamps for sensor data:

**Temperature Sensor Data:**
```json
{
    "device_id": "T01",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-16T10:30:45+02:00",
    "data": [
        {"type": "temperature", "value": 23.5, "unit": "Â°C"},
        {"type": "humidity", "value": 65.2, "unit": "%"}
    ]
}
```

**Vehicle Tracker Data:**
```json
{
    "device_id": "V01", 
    "timestamp": "2024-10-16T10:30:45+02:00",
    "data": [
        {"type": "location", "value": 0, "unit": "Downtown Office"},
        {"type": "speed", "value": 45.2, "unit": "km/h"},
        {"type": "ignition", "value": 1, "unit": ""}
    ]
}
```

### Available Scripts

- **`scripts/iot_data_server.py`** - Main TCP server for data ingestion

- **`scripts/clean_database.py`** - Database cleanup utility (preserves admin users)
- **`scripts/start_iot_system.sh`** - Helper script with startup instructions

### Client Simulator Options

**Multi-Device Simulation (Recommended):**
```bash
# Send data for both temperature sensor and vehicle every 20 seconds
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --multi --interval 20

# Multiple devices with different intervals
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --device OALLM220 --interval 25 --device T01 --interval 15
```

**Single Device Simulation:**
```bash
# Just temperature sensor
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --device T01 --interval 15

# Just vehicle  
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --device OALLM220 --interval 25

# Send specific number of readings
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --count 10 --interval 2

# Send single test reading
python scripts/iot_data_client.py --test
```

### Historical Data Analysis

The system provides comprehensive historical data analysis:

- **Date/Time Filtering**: Select specific date and time ranges for analysis
- **Device Filtering**: Filter by specific devices or view all devices
- **Data Type Filtering**: Filter by specific sensor types (temperature, humidity, location, etc.)
- **Dynamic Tables**: Automatically generates device-specific columns
- **Smart Formatting**: 
  - Ignition status shows ON/OFF instead of 1/0
  - Location shows place names when available
  - Speed values with units in column headers
- **CSV Export**: One-click export of filtered data to CSV format
  - Exports exactly what's shown in the filtered table
  - Excel-compatible CSV files with proper formatting
  - Smart filename generation based on date range
  - Includes timestamps, device info, and all sensor data
- **Timezone Handling**: All timestamps converted to local time (Europe/Berlin) for display

### Troubleshooting IoT System

**Port 8888 already in use:**
```bash
# Find and kill existing process
ss -tlnp | grep :8888
kill <process_id>
```

**Connection refused:**
- Ensure IoT Data Server is running first
- Check if Django server is running on port 8000
- Verify device exists in database with correct ID

**No data in dashboard:**
- Refresh the dashboard page
- Check server console for successful data storage messages
- Verify auto-refresh is enabled (green indicator in dashboard)

**Timezone Issues:**
- Server logs show client timestamps (device time) vs stored UTC time
- Historical data displays in local time (Europe/Berlin timezone)
- Client sends timezone-aware timestamps for offline data scenarios

**Historical Data Not Showing:**
- Ensure date/time filters are set correctly
- Check that devices exist in database (run Django shell query)
- Verify timezone settings in Django settings.py
